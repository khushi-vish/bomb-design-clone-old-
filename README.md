# My First Website

This was my very first website, created when I was just starting to learn HTML and CSS. At the time, 
I didn’t know much about web layout, so I relied heavily on margins and padding to shape the design. 

The website isn’t responsive (because I didn’t know how to do that back then), I learned a lot along the way, 
especially about HTML attributes, CSS properties, and icon placement. The most challenging part was positioning elements, 
which took a lot of trial and error to get right!
